## About this site.
  - Made with Next.js.
  - CSS Modules I love that I don't have to worry about naming of css     classes and scoping using css modules is a breeze.
  - Spotify API to show what I'm listening and the las 10 song most listened.
  - Notion API [beta] connected to a personal db where I keep al those places where i go to find inspiration or clarify concepts.
  - TIC TAC TOE game is using a minimax algo, Let me know if tou can win.
  - React Context to manage the state of the app, 
  - Dark Theme
  - Animations with Framer Notion [previously react-spring]

## Notion API

 ```
    /api/notion?sort=<ascending|descending>&tag=<"any tag received previously"|"">
  
   // :sort  >  descending || ascending  > default : ascending
   // :tag  >  any tag received previously  || ""  > empty string returns all the elements > no 'tag' query will return all the elements.
  ```
#### Planing
 - Create a blog to share experiences and implementation of resources
